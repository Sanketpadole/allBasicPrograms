	What is OOPS?Object-Oriented Programming

	System (OOPs) is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
			It allows users to create objects they want and create methods to handle those objects.
			The basic concept of OOPs is to create objects, re-use them throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get results.
